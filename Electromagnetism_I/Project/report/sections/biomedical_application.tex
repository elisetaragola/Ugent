Since this report was written by three students in biomedical engineering, this section looks shortly in the application of transmission line theory in this field of engineering. A small study of literature was conducted to gather some insight in this topic.
When one thinks of electric signals related to the human body, of course the nervous system immediately comes to mind. Neuro-engineering is a very active field within biomedical engineering. The foundation of modelling nerve impulses was built by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1951. They constructed a model to replicate the specific way
