These tails, which represent the path travelled by the particles, are correlated with the diffusion coefficient. Using Stokes-Einstein equation makes it possible to deduce the particle diameter.
\begin{equation}
	C_D = \frac{k_BT}{3\pi\mu D}
\end{equation}
with $C_D$ the diffusion coefficient, $k_B$ the Boltzman constant, $\mu$ the viscosity of the medium and $D$ the diameter of the particle.\\
By counting the number of highlighted points belonging to a certain path makes it possible to calculate the size concentration.
