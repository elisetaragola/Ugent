abstract = {In order to reduce the production cost of polylactic acid (PLA), l-lactic acid was polymerized by direct polycondensation (DP) under vacuum without catalysts, solvents and initiators. Experiments were conducted at polymerization temperatures (Tp) of 150–250°C. The maximum PLA molecular weight obtained was 90kDa at 200°C after 89h under vacuum. Above 200°C, PLA is thermally degraded by specific scission. The DP activation energy (Ea) was also investigated and was found to be larger than that required by catalyzed ring opening polymerization (ROP). Furthermore, the Ea was higher than the deactivation energy (Ed) for both DP and ROP. PLA yields were higher at lower Tp, while the yield of lactide increased with Tp. The total yield of PLA and lactide was approximately 52-75wt.%. The uncatalyzed DP method may have applications in on-site cell plant production, where compactness is required, as well as safe and simple operating procedures.}

    abstract = "{Among the bio-based polymers developed so far, PLA polymers and their derivatives stand at the forefront of practical use and are currently manufactured. PLLA obtained from naturally occurring l-lactic acid is generally produced and utilized on an industrial scale. Two synthetic routes to PLLA have been known: one is the ROP of l-lactide and the other is the direct polycondensation of l-lactic acid. In the former method, various polymerization mechanisms have been demonstrated. Among them, bulk polymerization of l-lactide monomer in the presence of tin octoate is favoured to avoid racemization and trans-esterification (chain scrambling). This ROP method is the most convenient for controlling the molecular weight of PLLA and attaining a high molecular weight polymer (Mw\\&gt;1×106). NatureWorks LLC (USA) and other current manufacturers of PLLA depend on this ROP route for their production. Many other catalysts, based on organic, cationic and metal compounds, are also effective for ROP, although their process control has not yet been fully established. The alternative direct polycondensation of l-lactic acid has been less studied compared to the ROP method. Recently, much effort has been made to establish the direct polycondensation method. A key technology for its success is the melt/solid polycondensation, by which a high molecular weight of PLLA and sb-PLA can be produced at lower cost. Stereo-complexed PLA materials and PLA copolymers consisting of different macromolecular chains can also be synthesized for higher performance and specialties. The molecular weight, terminal groups, copolymer composition and functionalities must be precisely controlled for wider application of these PLA polymers.}",

Different poly(lactide)s are distinguished{,} namely stereoregular PLLA and PDLA{,} atactic{,} heterotactic{,} syndiotactic and stereoblock PLAs.
