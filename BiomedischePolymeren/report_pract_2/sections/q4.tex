\subsection{Question 4: Processing}

2-Photon Polymerization (2PP) is a suitable technique to replace traditional photolithography when speed is not a critical factor. In 2PP, two photons are absorbed by the photo-initiator, resulting in a highly localized crosslinking reaction that yields high resolution. Additionally, 2PP allows for precise control over process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, and exposure time.
