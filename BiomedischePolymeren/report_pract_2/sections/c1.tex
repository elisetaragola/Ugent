\subsection{Amount of methacrylic anhydride}

10 w/v\% gelatin is created by dissolving 1g [0.385 mmol of amine of (dihydroxy)lysine and ornithine/g] in a phosphate buffer. Methacrylic anhydride with a molecular weight of 154.16 g/mol and density of 1.035 g/ml is used. 2.5 equivalents of methacrylic anhydride with respect to the amine groups are added to the gelatin. The amount of methacrylic anhydride needed is then calculated as:

\begin{align}
    n_{\text{amine}} & = 1g\cdot 0.385\frac{\unit{mmol}}{\g} = 0.385 \unit{mmol}\\
    \Rightarrow n_{\text{methacrylic anhydride}} &= 2.5\cdot n_{\text{amine}} = 0.9625 \unit{mmol} \\
    \Rightarrow m_{\text{methacrylic anhydride}} &= 154.16 \frac{\g}{\unit{mol}} \cdot n_{\text{methacrylic anhydride}} = 148 \unit{mg}\\
    \Rightarrow V_{\text{methacrylic anhydride}} &= \frac{m_{\text{methacrylic anhydride}}}{1.035 \g/\ml} = 143\mu l
\end{align}
