\subsection{Amount of photo-initiator}

The intensities used for the calculation were obtained from the H-NMR spectra on ufora. A 10 w/v\% gelMA solution is prepared by dissolving 0.5 g in MilliQ-water in which
2 mol\% photo-initiator[Irgacure 2959, MW = 224.3 g/mol] is added with respect to the total amount of double bonds present. The amount of photo-initiator needed is then calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    m_{\text{photo-initiator}} = 0.02 \cdot 0.5 \g \cdot DS \cdot n_{\text{amine}} \cdot MW = 0.83 \unit{mg}
\end{equation}

The degree of substitution (DS) is calculated using formula \ref{eq:DS}.
