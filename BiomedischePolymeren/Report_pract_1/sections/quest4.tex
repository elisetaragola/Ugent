\subsection{Similar ATRP experiment}

    The resulting DPI values from the conducted experiment in the video vary between 1.121-1.159. 
    These values are lower then the conventional radical polymerisation. This implies that there is
    less spread on the polymer chain length after conducting ATRP in comparison with the conventional
    radical polymerisation.
