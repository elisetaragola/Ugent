Specifically, we shall consider here, the design of a *notch* filter. This filter can be used to zero a specific frequency. As we shall see in the practical example that follows, this approach can be applied to remove harmonic disturbances from interfering sources (e.g., power supply hum affecting the measurement of biomedical signals is a frequently seen source of disturbance in the real world).\n",
